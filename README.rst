PyPhi is a Python library for computing integrated information (|phi|), and the
associated quantities and objects.

**If you use this code, please cite it, as well as the** `IIT 3.0 paper
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003588>`_.

To cite the code, use the Zenodo DOI for the verison you used. The latest one
is `10.5281/zenodo.55692 <http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.55692>`_.
For example::

    Will Mayner et al. (2016). pyphi: 0.8.1. Zenodo. 10.5281/zenodo.55692

Or in BibTeX::

    @misc{pyphi,
      author = {Mayner, Will and
                Marshall, William and
                Marchman, Bo},
      title  = {pyphi: 0.8.1},
      month  = Feb,
      year   = 2016,
      doi    = {10.5281/zenodo.55692},
      url    = {http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.55692}
    }

(Just make sure to use the version number, DOI, and URL for the version you
actually used.)


Usage, Examples, and API documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check out the `documentation for the latest stable release
<http://pyphi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, or the `documentation for the
latest (potentially unstable) development version
<http://pyphi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

The documentation is also available within the Python interpreter with the
``help`` function.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set up a Python 3 virtual environment and install with

.. code:: bash

    pip install pyphi

To install the latest development version, which is a work in progress and may
have bugs, run:

.. code:: bash

    pip install "git+https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi@develop#egg=pyphi"

**Note:** this software has only been tested on the Mac OS X and Linux
operating systems. Windows is not supported, though it might work with minor
modifications. If you do get it to work, a writeup of the steps would be much
appreciated!


Detailed installation guide for Mac OS X
````````````````````````````````````````

`See here <https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi/blob/develop/INSTALLATION.md>`_.


Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~

For technical issues with PyPhi or feature requests, please use the `issues
page <https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi/issues>`_.

For discussion about the software or integrated information theory in general,
you can join the `PyPhi users group
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyphi-users>`_.


Contributing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To help develop PyPhi, fork the project on GitHub and install the requirements
with ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.


Development workflow
````````````````````

The ``Makefile`` defines some tasks to help with development:

.. code:: bash

    make test

runs the unit tests every time you change the source code.

.. code:: bash

    make benchmark

runs performance benchmarks.

.. code:: bash

    make docs

builds the HTML documentation.

``Gruntfile.js`` defines similar tasks. To get grunt, first install
`Node.js <http://nodejs.org/>`_. Then, within the ``pyphi`` directory, run
``npm install`` to install the local npm dependencies, then run
``sudo npm install -g grunt grunt-cli`` to install the ``grunt`` command to your
system. You should now be able to run tasks with ``grunt``.


Developing on Linux
```````````````````

Make sure you install the Python 3 C headers before installing the
requirements:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-scipy python3-numpy
