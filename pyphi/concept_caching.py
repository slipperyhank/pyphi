class NormalizedMechanism:
    """A mechanism rendered into a normal form, suitable for use as a cache key
    in concept memoization.

    The broad outline for the normalization procedure is as follows:

    - Get the set of all nodes that input to (output from) at least one
      mechanism node.
    - Sort the Marbls in a stable way (this is done by marbl-python, when the
      MarblSet is initialized).
    - Iterate over the sorted Marbls; for each one, iterate over its
      corresponding mechanism node's inputs (outputs).
    - Label each input (output) with a unique integer. These are the
      "normalized indices" of the inputs (outputs).
    - Record the inverse mapping, which sends a normalized index to a real
      index.
    - Record the state of the mechanism and all input/ouptut nodes.

    Then two normalized mechanisms are the same if they have the same
    MarblSets, inputs, outputs, state, and input/output state.

    Attributes:
        marblset (MarblSet): A dictionary where keys are directions, and values
            are MarblSets containing Marbls generated from the TPMs of the
            mechanism nodes' corresponding to the direction.
        normalized_indices (dict): A dictionary where keys are directions, and
            values are dictionaries mapping mechanism node indices to their
            normalized indices for that direction.
        unnormalized_indices (dict): The inverse of ``normalized_indices``.
        inputs (tuple(tuple(int))): A tuple where the |ith| element contains a
            tuple of the normalized indices of the |ith| node, where |i| is a
            normalized index.
        outputs (tuple(tuple(int))): The same as ``inputs``, but the elements
            contain normalized indices of the outputs.
        permutation (dict()): A dictionary where the keys are directions and
            the values are the permutations that maps mechanism nodes to the
            position of their marbl in the marblset for that direction.
