    """A set of nodes in a network, with state transitions.

    A |Context| contains two |Subsystem| objects - one representing the system
    at time |t-1| used to compute effect coefficients, and another
    representing the system at time |t| which is used to compute cause
    coefficients. These subsystems are accessed with the ``effect_system`` and
    ``cause_system`` attributes, and are mapped to the causal directions via
    the ``system`` attribute.

    Args:
        network (Network): The network the subsystem belongs to.
        before_state (tuple[int]): The state of the network at
            time |t-1|.
        after_state (tuple[int]): The state of the network at
            time |t|.
        cause_indices (tuple[int] or tuple[str]): Indices of nodes in the cause
            system. (TODO: clarify)
        effect_indices (tuple[int] or tuple[str]): Indices of nodes in the
            effect system. (TODO: clarify)

    Attributes:
        node_indices (tuple[int]): The indices of the nodes in the system.
        network (Network): The network the system belongs to.
        before_state (tuple[int]): The state of the network at
            time |t-1|.
        after_state (tuple[int]): The state of the network at
            time |t|.
        effect_system (Subsystem): The system in ``before_state`` used to
            compute effect repertoires and coefficients.
        cause_system (Subsystem): The system in ``after_state`` used to compute
            cause repertoires and coefficients.
        cause_system (Subsystem):
        system (dict): A dictionary mapping causal directions to the system
            used to compute repertoires in that direction.
        cut (ActualCut): The cut that has been applied to this context.

    .. note::
        During initialization, both the cause and effect systems are
        conditioned on the ``before_state`` as the background state. After
        conditioning the ``effect_system`` is then properly reset to
