"""
Methods for computing actual causation of subsystems and mechanisms.

Bidirectional analysis of a transition:
    Note: during the init the subsystem should always come with the past state.
    This is because the subsystem should take the past state as background
    states in both directions. Then in the "past" case, the subsystem state
    should be swapped, to condition on the current state. All functions that
    take subsystems assume that the subsystem has already been prepared in this
    way.

    "past": evaluate cause-repertoires given current state
        background: past, condition on: current, actual state: past

    "future": evaluate effect-repertoires given past state
        background: past, condition on: past, actual state: current

To do this with the minimal effort, the subsystem state and actual state have
to be swapped in the "past" case, after the subsystem is conditioned on the
background condition.
