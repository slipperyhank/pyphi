class Network:

    """A network of nodes.

    Represents the network we're analyzing and holds auxilary data about it.

    Example:
        In a 3-node network, ``a_network.tpm[(0, 0, 1)]`` gives the transition
        probabilities for each node at |t_0| given that state at |t_{-1}| was
        |0,0,1|.

    Args:
        tpm (np.ndarray): See the corresponding attribute.
        current_state (tuple): See the corresponding attribute.
        past_state (tuple): See the corresponding attribute.

    Keyword Args:
        connectivity_matrix (array or sequence): A square binary adjacency
            matrix indicating the connections between nodes in the network.
            ``connectivity_matrix[i][j] == 1`` means that node |i| is connected
            to node |j|. If no connectivity matrix is given, every node is
            connected to every node **(including itself)**.

    Attributes:
        tpm (np.ndarray):
            The transition probability matrix that encodes the network's
            mechanism. It can be provided in either state-by-node or
            state-by-state form. In state-by-state form, decimal indices must
            correspond to states so that lower-order bits of the binary
            representation of the index give the state of low-index nodes (see
            note below). If given in state-by-node form, it can be either
            2-dimensional, so that ``tpm[i]`` gives the probabilities of each
            node being on if the past state is given by the binary
            representation of |i|, where again, low-order bits correspond to
            low-index nodes, or in N-D form, so that ``tpm[0][1][0]`` gives the
            probabilities of each node being on if the past state is |0,1,0|.
            The shape of the 2-dimensional form of the TPM must be ``(S, N)``,
            and the shape of the N-D form of the TPM must be ``[2] * N + [N]``,
            where ``S`` is the number of states and ``N`` is the number of
            nodes in the network.
        current_state (tuple):
            The current state of the network. ``current_state[i]`` gives the
            current state of node |i|.
        past_state (tuple):
            The past state of the network. ``past_state[i]`` gives the past
            state of node |i|.
        connectivity_matrix (np.ndarray):
            A square binary adjacency matrix indicating the connections between
            nodes in the network.
        size (int):
            The number of nodes in the network.
        num_states (int):
            The number of possible states of the network.

    .. note::
        Throughout PyPhi, when decimal indices are used to represent the state
        of a set of binary nodes, the low-order bits of the binary
        representation of the decimal index correspond to the low-index nodes.
        The rationale is that this low-order to low-index mapping is more
        stable under changes in the number of nodes, in that the same bit
        always corresponds to the same node index.
