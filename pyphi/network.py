    Represents the network we're analyzing and holds auxilary data about it.

    Example:
        In a 3-node network, ``a_network.tpm[(0, 0, 1)]`` gives the transition
        probabilities for each node at |t_0| given that state at |t_{-1}| was
        |N_0 = 0, N_1 = 0, N_2 = 1|.

    Args:
        tpm (np.ndarray): See the corresponding attribute.

    Keyword Args:
        connectivity_matrix (array or sequence): A square binary adjacency
            matrix indicating the connections between nodes in the network.
            ``connectivity_matrix[i][j] == 1`` means that node |i| is connected
            to node |j|. If no connectivity matrix is given, every node is
            connected to every node **(including itself)**.

    Attributes:
        tpm (np.ndarray):
            The network's transition probability matrix. It can be provided in
            either state-by-node (either 2-D or N-D) or state-by-state form. In
            either form, row indices must follow the **LOLI** convention (see
            discussion in the |examples| module), and in state-by-state form,
            so must column indices. If given in state-by-node form, it can be
            either 2-dimensional, so that ``tpm[i]`` gives the probabilities of
            each node being on if the past state is encoded by |i| according to
            **LOLI**, or in N-D form, so that ``tpm[(0, 0, 1)]`` gives the
            probabilities of each node being on if the past state is |N_0 = 0,
            N_1 = 0, N_2 = 1|. The shape of the 2-dimensional form of a
            state-by-node TPM must be ``(S, N)``, and the shape of the N-D form
            of the TPM must be ``[2] * N + [N]``, where ``S`` is the number of
            states and ``N`` is the number of nodes in the network.
        connectivity_matrix (np.ndarray):
            A square binary adjacency matrix indicating the connections between
            nodes in the network.
        size (int):
            The number of nodes in the network.
        num_states (int):
            The number of possible states of the network.
